## Components

### SongList

Main component for displaying the song library with filtering capabilities.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { SongList } from '@/components/songs';

<SongList />;
```

**Sub-components:**

- `Table` - Displays songs in a table format
- `Empty` - Shows when no songs are found
- `Filter` - Allows filtering by difficulty level

### SongForm

Form component for creating and editing songs.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { SongForm } from '@/components/songs';

<SongForm mode="create" onSuccess={() => router.push('/songs')} />
<SongForm mode="edit" song={existingSong} onSuccess={() => router.push('/songs')} />
```

**Sub-components:**

- `Content` - Handles form state, validation, and submission
- `Fields` - Composes all form fields
- `FieldText` - Reusable text input field
- `FieldSelect` - Reusable select dropdown field

### SongDetail

Component for displaying detailed information about a song.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { SongDetail } from '@/components/songs';

<SongDetail songId='uuid' onDeleted={() => router.push('/songs')} />;
```

**Sub-components:**

- `Header` - Displays song title and author
- `Info` - Shows level, key, chords, and Ultimate Guitar link
- `Actions` - Edit and delete buttons (for teachers/admins only)

### SongFormGuard

Wrapper component that enforces teacher/admin role requirements for the form.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { SongFormGuard } from '@/components/songs';

<SongFormGuard mode="create" onSuccess={() => router.push('/songs')} />
<SongFormGuard mode="edit" songId="uuid" onSuccess={() => router.push('/songs')} />
```

## Hooks

### useSongList

Hook for fetching and managing the song list with filtering.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { useSongList } from '@/components/songs';

const { songs, loading, error, filters, setFilters, refresh } = useSongList();
```

**Returns:**

- `songs: SongWithStatus[]` - Array of songs (may include status for students)
- `loading: boolean` - Loading state
- `error: string | null` - Error message if fetch failed
- `filters: SongFilters` - Current filter state
- `setFilters: (filters: SongFilters) => void` - Update filters
- `refresh: () => void` - Manually refresh the song list

### useSong

Hook for fetching a single song by ID.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { useSong } from '@/components/songs';

const { song, loading, error } = useSong(songId);
```

**Returns:**

- `song: Song | undefined` - The song data
- `loading: boolean` - Loading state
- `error: string | null` - Error message if fetch failed

## Types

All shared types are exported from `types/index.ts`:

```tsx
import type {
	Song,
	SongWithStatus,
	SongLevel,
	SongFilters,
	SongStatus,
} from '@/components/songs';
```

**Type Definitions:**

- `Song` - Base song type from database
- `SongWithStatus` - Song with optional progress status
- `SongLevel` - `'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'`
- `SongStatus` - `'to_learn' | 'started' | 'remembered' | 'with_author' | 'mastered'`
- `SongFilters` - Filter object for song queries

## Design Principles

This structure follows the project's "Small Components Policy":

1. **Focused Components** - Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Composability** - Small components combine to build larger features
3. **Co-location** - Related components live together in folders
4. **Reusability** - Form fields and other UI elements are extracted
5. **Separation of Concerns** - Logic (hooks) separated from presentation (components)

## Role-Based Access

Components respect user roles:

- **Teachers/Admins**: Can create, edit, and delete songs
- **Students**: Can only view songs and their assigned progress

Role checks are handled by:

- `useAuth()` hook in components
- `RequireTeacher` wrapper in `SongFormGuard`
- API endpoints enforce server-side validation
