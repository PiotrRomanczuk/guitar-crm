# Practice Schedule Builder

## Overview

Generate day-by-day practice schedules tailored to each student's active repertoire, skill level, and available time. Outputs printable schedules with exercises, time allocations, and progress checkboxes.

## Usage

When invoked, gather:

1. **Student** -- name or ID
2. **Practice days** -- which days per week (default: Mon-Fri)
3. **Daily practice time** -- minutes available (default: 30)
4. **Next lesson date** -- to work backwards from (default: next 7 days)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Fetch Active Songs

```sql
SELECT s.title, s.author, s.level, s.key, s.chords, sr.status
FROM student_repertoire sr
JOIN songs s ON s.id = sr.song_id
WHERE sr.student_id = '<student_id>'
  AND sr.status != 'mastered'
ORDER BY
  CASE sr.status
    WHEN 'started' THEN 1
    WHEN 'to_learn' THEN 2
    WHEN 'remembered' THEN 3
  END;
```

### Step 2: Fetch Pending Assignments

```sql
SELECT title, description, due_date
FROM assignments
WHERE student_id = '<student_id>'
  AND status != 'completed'
ORDER BY due_date;
```

### Step 3: Build Schedule

Distribute songs across practice days using these rules:

**Time Blocks** (for 30 min daily):

| Block | Time | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Warm-up | 5 min | Finger exercises, stretches |
| Focus song | 10 min | Active "started" song -- deep work |
| Secondary song | 8 min | Rotation of other active songs |
| Technique | 5 min | Exercises related to current songs |
| Cool-down review | 2 min | Quick run of a "remembered" song |

Scale proportionally for other durations (15, 20, 45, 60 min).

**Song Rotation Logic**:
- **`started` songs**: appear 3-4x per week (highest frequency)
- **`to_learn` songs**: appear 1-2x per week (introduction pace)
- **`remembered` songs**: appear 1x per week (maintenance)
- Never schedule more than 3 songs per day
- Pair challenging songs with easier ones

### Step 4: Output Schedule

## Output Template

```markdown
# Weekly Practice Schedule: {Student Name}
**Week of**: {start_date} | **Next lesson**: {lesson_date}
**Daily target**: {minutes} minutes

---

## Monday
- [ ] **Warm-up** (5 min): {level-appropriate exercises}
- [ ] **"{Song A}"** (10 min): Focus on {specific section/skill}
- [ ] **"{Song B}"** (8 min): {practice goal}
- [ ] **Technique** (5 min): {exercise name}
- [ ] **Review** (2 min): Quick play-through of "{Song C}"

## Tuesday
- [ ] **Warm-up** (5 min): {exercises}
- [ ] **"{Song A}"** (10 min): {different section than Monday}
- [ ] **"{Song D}"** (8 min): {practice goal}
- [ ] **Technique** (5 min): {exercise}
- [ ] **Review** (2 min): "{Song E}"

{... repeat for each practice day ...}

## Before Your Lesson ({lesson_date})
- [ ] Run through "{Song A}" start to finish
- [ ] Review any tricky sections marked above
- [ ] Write down questions for your teacher

## This Week's Goals
1. {Measurable goal for primary song}
2. {Technique milestone}
3. {Assignment due date reminder}

**Tip of the week**: {context-appropriate practice tip}
```

## Warm-up Exercises by Level

### Beginner
- Finger stretches (30 sec each hand)
- Open string picking (alternate picking, each string 4x)
- Chord transition drill: {chord1} → {chord2} (1 min, metronome at 60 BPM)

### Intermediate
- Spider exercise (frets 1-4, all strings)
- Chromatic scale (ascending/descending, 80 BPM)
- Fingerpicking pattern: p-i-m-a on open chords

### Advanced
- Scale runs in current key (2 octaves, 100+ BPM)
- Arpeggio patterns across chord shapes
- Improvisation warm-up over backing track (2 min)

## Practice Tips Library

Rotate these tips based on student level:

- "Use a metronome! Start slow and increase 5 BPM when comfortable."
- "Practice the hard parts first while your fingers are fresh."
- "Record yourself and listen back -- you'll hear things you miss while playing."
- "If you can play it slow, you can play it fast. Never rush."
- "Take a 1-minute break between songs to reset your focus."
- "Practice chord changes in isolation before playing the full song."

## Delivery Options

- **Markdown**: output in conversation (default)
- **PDF**: use `pdf` skill to generate printable version
- **Email**: send to student via notification service

## Error Handling

- **No active songs**: suggest beginner exercises and recommend adding songs to repertoire
- **Only mastered songs**: congratulate student, suggest advancing to new material
- **Very short practice time** (< 15 min): focus on one song + warm-up only
- **No practice days selected**: default to weekdays (Mon-Fri)

## Examples

**Input**: "Create a practice schedule for Alex, 30 min daily, Mon-Fri"

**Input**: "Weekly practice plan for student abc-123, 45 min, next lesson Thursday"

**Input**: "Generate practice schedules for all active students"
