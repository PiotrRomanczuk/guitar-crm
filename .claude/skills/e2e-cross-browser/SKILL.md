# E2E Cross-Browser Testing

## Overview

Run Strummy's Playwright E2E tests across all 7 configured device projects (3 desktop browsers, 2 phones, 2 tablets) with structured reporting. Supports four run modes for different scenarios: quick validation, full coverage, mobile-focused, and desktop-focused. Produces a per-device pass/fail matrix and identifies device-specific failures.

## When to Use

- Before a release to verify cross-browser compatibility
- After CSS/layout changes to catch responsive breakpoint issues
- When investigating a device-specific bug report
- During mobile-first development to verify phone/tablet rendering
- After upgrading Playwright or browser engines
- When CI only runs Desktop Chrome and you need broader coverage locally

## Device Projects

Defined in `playwright.config.ts`:

| # | Project Name | Type | Viewport | Engine |
|---|-------------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Desktop Chrome | Desktop | 1920x1080 | Chromium |
| 2 | Desktop Firefox | Desktop | 1920x1080 | Firefox |
| 3 | Desktop Safari | Desktop | 1920x1080 | WebKit |
| 4 | iPhone 12 | Phone | 390x844 | WebKit (mobile) |
| 5 | iPhone 15 Pro Max | Phone | 430x932 | WebKit (mobile) |
| 6 | iPad Pro | Tablet | 1024x1366 | WebKit (mobile) |
| 7 | iPad (gen 7) | Tablet | 810x1080 | WebKit (mobile) |

## Usage

Invoke by asking Claude to run cross-browser tests:

```
Run cross-browser E2E tests (quick mode)
Run full device coverage E2E tests
Run mobile-only E2E tests
Run E2E tests on iPad Pro only
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Environment Check

Verify Playwright browsers are installed and the dev server is reachable.

```bash
# Check installed browsers
npx playwright install --dry-run 2>&1

# If browsers are missing, install them
npx playwright install

# Check dev server (Playwright config auto-starts it, but verify)
curl -s --head http://localhost:3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 \
  && echo "Dev server running" \
  || echo "Dev server will be started by Playwright"
```

Verify test files exist:

```bash
ls tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts tests/*.spec.ts 2>/dev/null
```

**Current E2E test specs (from `tests/`):**

| Spec File | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| `tests/e2e/smoke/critical-path.spec.ts` | Smoke tests |
| `tests/e2e/auth/sign-up-complete.spec.ts` | Auth flows |
| `tests/e2e/onboarding/complete-flow.spec.ts` | Onboarding |
| `tests/e2e/integration/workflows.spec.ts` | Integration workflows |
| `tests/e2e/mobile/mobile-responsiveness.spec.ts` | Mobile responsive |
| `tests/e2e/ai/ai-playground.spec.ts` | AI features |
| `tests/e2e/ai/assignment-ai.spec.ts` | AI assignments |
| `tests/e2e/ai/lesson-notes-ai.spec.ts` | AI lesson notes |
| `tests/student-learning-journey.spec.ts` | Student journey |
| `tests/student-full-journey.spec.ts` | Student full flow |
| `tests/teacher-full-journey.spec.ts` | Teacher full flow |

---

### Phase 2: Select Run Mode

Four predefined modes plus custom project selection:

**Quick mode** -- fast validation, two key devices:

```bash
npx playwright test --project="Desktop Chrome" --project="iPhone 12"
```

| Projects | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Desktop Chrome, iPhone 12 | Pre-commit check, fast feedback loop |

**Full mode** -- all 7 devices:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

| Projects | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| All 7 projects | Pre-release verification, full coverage |

**Mobile mode** -- phones and tablets only:

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project="iPhone 12" \
  --project="iPhone 15 Pro Max" \
  --project="iPad Pro" \
  --project="iPad (gen 7)"
```

| Projects | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| iPhone 12, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad Pro, iPad (gen 7) | Mobile-first validation, responsive testing |

**Desktop mode** -- all desktop browsers:

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project="Desktop Chrome" \
  --project="Desktop Firefox" \
  --project="Desktop Safari"
```

| Projects | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| Desktop Chrome, Desktop Firefox, Desktop Safari | Cross-browser compatibility |

**Custom mode** -- user-specified projects:

```bash
npx playwright test --project="iPad Pro" --project="Desktop Firefox"
```

**Existing npm scripts (from `package.json`):**

These can be used as shortcuts instead of raw `npx playwright test` commands:

```bash
npm run test:pw:iphone12        # iPhone 12 only
npm run test:pw:iphone15        # iPhone 15 Pro Max only
npm run test:pw:ipad            # iPad Pro only
npm run test:pw:desktop         # Desktop Chrome only
npm run test:pw:mobile          # iPhone 12 + iPhone 15 Pro Max
npm run test:pw:tablet          # iPad Pro + iPad (gen 7)
npm run test:pw:devices         # iPhone 12 + iPad Pro + Desktop Chrome
npm run test:pw:all             # All projects
```

---

### Phase 3: Execute Tests

Run the selected projects. Configure based on environment:

**Local execution:**

```bash
npx playwright test \
  --project="<selected-projects>" \
  --reporter=json \
  --output=test-results/cross-browser
```

**Key Playwright config values (from `playwright.config.ts`):**
- Timeout: 30s per test
- Expect timeout: 10s
- Retries: 0 locally, 2 in CI
- Parallel: fully parallel
- Screenshots: only on failure
- Video: retain on failure
- Traces: on first retry
- Web server: auto-starts `npm run dev`

**For long-running full suite, provide progress updates:**

```
Running: Desktop Chrome (project 1/7)...
  12/12 tests passed (34s)

Running: Desktop Firefox (project 2/7)...
  11/12 tests passed, 1 failed (41s)
  FAIL: teacher-full-journey.spec.ts > should display lesson calendar

Running: Desktop Safari (project 3/7)...
```

### Phase 4: Build Results Matrix

Parse the JSON reporter output and build a pass/fail matrix.

**Matrix format:**

```

### Phase 5: Analyze Failures

For each failing test, provide diagnosis and categorization.

**Failure categories:**

| Category | Indicators | Common Fix |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Viewport/responsive | Fails only on small viewports | Fix CSS breakpoints, check `md:` / `lg:` Tailwind classes |
| Browser engine | Fails only on Firefox or WebKit | Check browser-specific CSS, API compatibility |
| Touch interaction | Fails only on mobile devices | Replace hover-dependent UX with tap-friendly alternatives |
| Timing/flaky | Fails intermittently across devices | Add `waitFor`, increase timeouts, use `toBeVisible()` |
| Auth/session | Fails on first run, passes on retry | Check cookie handling across browsers |
| Layout shift | Element not found at expected position | Fix CLS, use stable selectors (`data-testid`) |

**Per-failure report:**

```
FAILURE ANALYSIS
================

1. workflows.spec.ts > "should filter by date range" [Desktop Firefox]
   Category: Browser engine
   Error: Locator.click: Element is not visible
   Screenshot: test-results/cross-browser/workflows-firefox-failure.png

   Analysis: Firefox renders the date picker dropdown differently.
   The popover positioning overflows the viewport.

   Suggested fix: Add `sideOffset` prop to Radix Popover in
   components/lessons/LessonFilter.tsx

2. ai-playground.spec.ts > "should show AI response" [iPhone 12, iPhone 15]
   Category: Viewport/responsive
   Error: Timeout waiting for element [data-testid="ai-response"]
   Screenshot: test-results/cross-browser/ai-playground-iphone12-failure.png

   Analysis: AI response panel is hidden behind the input
   on small viewports. The response area needs scroll-into-view.

   Suggested fix: Add `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` or restructure
   the mobile layout in components/ai/AiPlayground.tsx
```

---

### Phase 6: Screenshots and Artifacts

Collect failure artifacts for debugging.

**Artifacts location (from `playwright.config.ts`):**

```
test-results/
  cross-browser/
    <test-name>-<project>/
      test-failed-1.png        # Screenshot on failure
      video.webm               # Video on failure (retain-on-failure)
      trace.zip                # Trace on first retry
```

**View artifacts:**

```bash
# Open HTML report with all results
npx playwright show-report

# View specific trace
npx playwright show-trace test-results/cross-browser/<test>/trace.zip
```

**Comparison screenshots (for responsive issues):**

When a test passes on desktop but fails on mobile, capture comparison screenshots:

```bash
# Desktop version (passing)
npx playwright test <spec> --project="Desktop Chrome" --update-snapshots

# Mobile version (failing)
npx playwright test <spec> --project="iPhone 12" --update-snapshots
```

## Mobile-First Validation Checklist

Since Strummy is a mobile-first app (70%+ tests should cover mobile), flag these common issues:

| Check | How to Verify |
|-------|--------------|
| Touch targets >= 44px | Audit clickable elements on iPhone viewport |
| No horizontal scroll | Check `overflow-x` on mobile viewports |
| Readable text without zoom | Font size >= 16px on mobile |
| Navigation accessible | Hamburger menu or bottom nav works |
| Forms usable on phone | Input fields not hidden by keyboard |
| Tables responsive | Use horizontal scroll or card layout on mobile |
| Modals fit viewport | Dialog/sheet doesn't overflow on small screens |
| Images sized correctly | No images wider than viewport |

## Key Project Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `playwright.config.ts` | Device definitions, timeouts, reporter config |
| `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` | E2E test specifications |
| `tests/global-teardown.ts` | Cleanup after test run |
| `test-results/` | Output directory for results and artifacts |
| `package.json` | Playwright scripts (`test:pw:*`) |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Browsers not installed | Run `npx playwright install` and retry |
| Dev server fails to start | Check port 3000, run `npm run dev` manually |
| All tests fail on one device | Likely browser install issue, reinstall that browser |
| Timeout on all tests | Check if app has blocking API calls, increase timeout |
| Auth tests fail everywhere | Verify test credentials in `playwright.config.ts` |
| Out of disk space (videos) | Clear `test-results/`, reduce video retention |
| Flaky test (passes on retry) | Mark as flaky, investigate timing issues |

## Examples

### Quick pre-commit check

```
Run cross-browser tests in quick mode
```

Runs Desktop Chrome + iPhone 12 only. Fast feedback in under 2 minutes.

### Full release verification

```
Run full cross-browser E2E coverage
```

Runs all 7 devices. Takes 5-10 minutes. Use before tagging a release.

### Investigate a mobile bug

```
Run E2E tests on iPhone 12 only, specifically the teacher-full-journey spec
```

```bash
npx playwright test tests/teacher-full-journey.spec.ts --project="iPhone 12"
```

### Compare desktop vs mobile

```
Run the smoke tests on Desktop Chrome and iPhone 12, compare results
```

```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/smoke/ --project="Desktop Chrome" --project="iPhone 12"
```
