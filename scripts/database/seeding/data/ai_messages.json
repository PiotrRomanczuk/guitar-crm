The student has successfully learned House of the Rising Sun and is now working on chord transitions. Key achievements:\n\n1. Consistent practice (8 sessions, 120 minutes total)\n2. Mastered basic chord progressions\n3. Good timing improvement with metronome practice\n4. Currently at 'remembered' status for House of the Rising Sun\n\nRecommendations:\n- Continue metronome practice to improve timing\n- Introduce more complex strumming patterns\n- Consider adding a new challenging song",

    "content": "Great question! Here are some specific tips for smoother chord changes in House of the Rising Sun:\n\n1. **Practice the transitions in isolation**\n   - Focus on Am → C transition first\n   - Then C → D, and D → F\n   - Practice each change 10 times slowly\n\n2. **Find the common fingers**\n   - Notice which fingers stay on the same strings\n   - Keep those fingers down while moving others\n\n3. **Use the metronome method**\n   - Start at 40 BPM, play each chord for 4 beats\n   - Gradually increase by 5 BPM when comfortable\n   - Your goal is 80-100 BPM\n\n4. **Visualize the next chord**\n   - Look ahead to where your fingers need to go\n   - Prepare the shape in your mind before moving\n\n5. **Practice routine**\n   - 5 min: Slow transitions without rhythm\n   - 10 min: With metronome\n   - 5 min: Play along with the song\n\nYou're making great progress with 8 practice sessions! Keep it up!",
