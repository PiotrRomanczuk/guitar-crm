## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

**Phase 1-2 Progress: 85% Complete** âœ…

### âœ… Recently Completed (Excellent Progress!)

- **Complete authentication system** with sign-up/sign-in forms and validation
- **Role-based access control** with protected routes (`ProtectedRoute`, `RequireAdmin`, etc.)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 110 passing tests
- **Navigation system** with role-based navigation (`Header`, `RoleBasedNav`)
- **Admin dashboard** with protection and basic layout
- **Database integration** with Supabase and RLS policies
- **TypeScript type safety** with Zod schemas

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 Weeks)

## 1. ðŸš€ Loading States & Error Handling (Priority: HIGH)

**Estimated: 1-2 days**

### Loading Components Needed:

```bash
components/ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingSpinner.tsx      # Reusable spinner component
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingSkeleton.tsx     # Skeleton placeholders
â”œâ”€â”€ LoadingButton.tsx       # Button with loading state
â”œâ”€â”€ ErrorBoundary.tsx       # React error boundary
â”œâ”€â”€ Toast.tsx              # Success/error notifications
â””â”€â”€ NotFound.tsx           # 404 page component
```

### Files to Create:

1. **Loading Spinner** - Replace inline spinners in `SupabaseTest` and auth forms
2. **Skeleton Components** - For user lists, song lists, lesson cards
3. **Error Boundary** - Catch React errors gracefully
4. **Toast System** - User feedback for actions (success/error messages)
5. **404 Pages** - User-friendly error pages

### Implementation Steps:

```bash
# 1. Start with TDD for UI components
npm run new-feature ui-components
npm run tdd

# 2. Create loading components first
# 3. Replace existing loading states
# 4. Add error boundaries to layout
# 5. Implement toast notifications
```

## 2. ðŸ‘¥ Admin User Management (Priority: HIGH)

**Estimated: 2-3 days**

### Pages to Create:

```bash
app/admin/
â”œâ”€â”€ users/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx           # User list with search/filter
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ create/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx       # Create new user form
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [id]/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx       # View user details
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ edit/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ page.tsx   # Edit user form
```

### Components Needed:

```bash
components/admin/
â”œâ”€â”€ UserList.tsx           # Paginated user list
â”œâ”€â”€ UserCard.tsx           # User display card
â”œâ”€â”€ UserForm.tsx           # Create/edit user form
â”œâ”€â”€ UserSearch.tsx         # Search and filters
â”œâ”€â”€ UserRoleToggle.tsx     # Role management UI
â””â”€â”€ BulkUserActions.tsx    # Bulk operations (delete, etc.)
```

### API Integration:

- **User CRUD operations** with Supabase
- **Role management** (admin, teacher, student flags)
- **Search and filtering** by name, email, role
- **Pagination** for large user lists
- **Bulk operations** (activate/deactivate, delete)

## 3. ðŸ‘¤ User Profile Management (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Estimated: 2 days**

### Files to Create:

```bash
app/profile/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx               # User profile view/edit
â””â”€â”€ settings/
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx           # Account settings

components/profile/
â”œâ”€â”€ ProfileForm.tsx        # Edit profile information
â”œâ”€â”€ ProfilePicture.tsx     # Avatar upload component
â”œâ”€â”€ PasswordChange.tsx     # Change password form
â””â”€â”€ AccountSettings.tsx    # Preferences & settings
```

### Features to Implement:

## 4. ðŸŽ¨ Dark/Light Mode Toggle (Priority: LOW)

**Estimated: 1 day**

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Create theme context** (`contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`)
2. **Add toggle component** (`components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
3. **Update layout** to include theme provider
4. **Test all components** with dark mode
5. **Store preference** in localStorage

## ðŸš¦ Development Workflow

### Before Starting Each Task:

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
npm run new-feature task-name

# 2. Start TDD mode
npm run tdd

# 3. Write tests first, then implementation
# 4. Run quality checks before committing
npm run quality
```

### Testing Strategy:

- **Unit tests** for all new components
- **Integration tests** for user flows
- **E2E tests** for critical paths
- **Maintain >70% coverage**
