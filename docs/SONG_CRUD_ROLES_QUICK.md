# Song CRUD Access Control - Summary

## ✅ What Was Just Implemented

Role-based access control has been **fully integrated** into the Song CRUD system. Here's what now happens:

### UI Access Matrix

```
                    STUDENT    TEACHER    ADMIN
────────────────────────────────────────────────
View Song List        ✅        ✅        ✅
View Song Detail      ✅        ✅        ✅
See "Create" Button   ❌        ✅        ✅
Create New Song       ❌        ✅        ✅
Edit Song             ❌        ✅        ✅
Delete Song           ❌        ✅        ✅
See Edit/Delete Btns  ❌        ✅        ✅
```

### Component-Level Implementation

**1. SongListHeader**

- Checks: `isTeacher || isAdmin`
- Shows "Create new song" button only for teachers/admins
- Students see clean song list without button

**2. SongDetail**

- Checks: `isTeacher || isAdmin`
- Shows "Edit" and "Delete" buttons only for teachers/admins
- Students see read-only view with chords and links

**3. SongFormGuard** (NEW)

- Wrapper component using `RequireTeacher` from auth system
- Protects form creation and editing routes
- Automatically redirects students to home page
- Used for `/songs/new` and `/songs/[id]/edit`

### Architecture Diagram

```
/songs (Song List Page)
├── SongList Component
│   └── SongListHeader
│       └── Check: isTeacher || isAdmin?
│           ├── YES → Show "Create Song" button
│           └── NO  → Hide button (students only)

/songs/[id] (Song Detail Page)
├── SongDetail Component
│   └── Check: isTeacher || isAdmin?
│       ├── YES → Show "Edit" & "Delete" buttons
│       └── NO  → Show read-only view

/songs/new (Create Song Page)
├── SongFormGuard
│   └── RequireTeacher wrapper
│       ├── YES → Render SongForm (create mode)
│       └── NO  → Redirect to /

/songs/[id]/edit (Edit Song Page)
├── SongFormGuard
│   └── RequireTeacher wrapper
│       ├── YES → Render SongForm (edit mode)
│       └── NO  → Redirect to /
```

## How It Works

### Student Journey

1. ✅ Visits `/songs` → Sees all songs in a list (no buttons)
2. ✅ Clicks on a song → Views details, chords, Ultimate Guitar link
3. ❌ Tries to create → Redirected (or no button visible)
4. ❌ Tries to edit → Redirected (buttons hidden)
5. ❌ Tries to delete → Can't see delete button

### Teacher Journey

1. ✅ Visits `/songs` → Sees all songs + **"Create Song"** button
2. ✅ Clicks "Create Song" → Form opens to create new song
3. ✅ Clicks on a song → Sees **"Edit"** and **"Delete"** buttons
4. ✅ Can edit song details → Form opens with current data
5. ✅ Can delete songs → With confirmation dialog

### Admin Journey

- Same as teacher + access to admin dashboard and user management

## Code Usage Examples

### In a Page Component

```tsx
// /app/songs/page.tsx
import { SongList } from '@/components/songs';

export default function SongsPage() {
	return <SongList />; // Automatically checks roles in components
}

// /app/songs/new/page.tsx
import { SongFormGuard } from '@/components/songs';

export default function NewSongPage() {
	return <SongFormGuard mode='create' />; // Redirects non-teachers
}

// /app/songs/[id]/edit/page.tsx
import { SongFormGuard } from '@/components/songs';

export default async function EditSongPage({ params }) {
	const { data: song } = await supabase
		.from('songs')
		.select('*')
		.eq('id', params.id)
		.single();

	return <SongFormGuard mode='edit' song={song} />; // Redirects non-teachers
}
```

### In Custom Components

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/components/auth/AuthProvider';

export default function CustomSongComponent() {
	const { isTeacher, isAdmin } = useAuth();
	const canManage = isTeacher || isAdmin;

	return (
		<>
			<h2>Song Details</h2>

			{canManage && <button onClick={handleEdit}>Edit</button>}
		</>
	);
}
```

## Security Layers

### ✅ Layer 1: Component-Level UI Control

- Buttons are hidden/shown based on user role
- Forms are wrapped with `RequireTeacher` guards
- Students are redirected from management pages

### ⏳ Layer 2: API-Level Validation (TODO)

- API routes will verify role before processing
- POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints check `isTeacher || isAdmin`

### ⏳ Layer 3: Database RLS Policies (TODO)

- Supabase RLS will enforce final security layer
- Even if someone bypasses API, database policies prevent unauthorized writes

## Key Features

✅ **Non-exclusive Roles**: Users can be teacher + student + admin simultaneously  
✅ **Consistent Pattern**: Use `isTeacher || isAdmin` for write operations  
✅ **Flexible**: Easy to add more role-specific features  
✅ **User-Friendly**: UI adapts automatically to user role  
✅ **Secure Redirects**: Form pages redirect unauthorized users
