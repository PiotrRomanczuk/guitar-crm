## 🎯 Key Highlights

### The Procedure in 3 Steps

```bash
1. git branch              # Check which branch you're on
2. git status              # Ensure working directory is clean
3. THEN open editor        # Only after verifying correct branch
```

### What Gets Checked

✅ Current branch name (should be `feature/*`)  
✅ Working directory status (should be clean)  
✅ Branch sync with remote (should be up to date)  
✅ No uncommitted changes (everything committed)

### Integrated Into

- Git workflow standards
- Development standards master guide
- Scripts documentation
- Copilot instructions
- TDD guide
